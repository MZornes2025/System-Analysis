# System Analysis – DriverPass Platform

## Overview  
This project models **DriverPass**, an online platform for students preparing for driving tests. Main features:  
- Students can schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, track their progress.  
- Instructors manage schedules.  
- Administrators oversee operations.  

Goal: design a system that is efficient, user-friendly, and secure for all user types.

## Technologies & Artifacts  
- System design documents (Business Requirements Document, System Design Document)  
- UML diagrams: use case, activity, sequence, class diagrams  
- Word / document artefacts with functional & nonfunctional requirements  

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Translated user & stakeholder interviews into structured requirements (functional & nonfunctional)  
- Created UML diagrams to model system behavior and user interactions  
- Designed a system that handles role-based access, schedule management, progress tracking  
- Emphasized performance, usability, and security in nonfunctional requirements  

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- My ability to go from client requirements → formal documentation → system design (i.e. theoretical + practical design skills)  
- Understanding of UML diagrams and how they relate to system behavior  
- Consideration of nonfunctional requirements (security, usability, performance) not just features  
- Skills in planning and analysis — essential for large software projects / game engineering pipelines etc.

## How to Explore This Repo  
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Open the design documents: `Driverpass_System_Design_Document.docx`, `Driverpass_Business_Requirements_Document.docx`.  
3. Review UML diagrams and the README for how the system is designed to work.  

## Optional Notes  
- Classroom setting project, but all analysis, design work, and documentation were done by me.  
- If needed, I can provide sample excerpts / sketches of diagrams or design visuals in other formats on request.
